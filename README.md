# VampireSneaking

It's a sneaking game including a vampire. Very spoopy.


## Controls

 - The player rotates to always look at where the mouse is pointing.
 - Turn into a bat by holding down shift, while a bat you move faster and is invisible to enemies (it drains blood while using it).
 - Stand right behind an enemy and press right click to drain blood. The enemy freezes whilst being drained.
